# Keys for Trello

A Chrome extension that supercharges Trello with loads of keyboard shortcuts.

Based on [Bulkan Evcimen's](https://github.com/bulkan) and [Tony Tamplin's](https://github.com/tonytamps) fantastic [Shortcuts for Trello](https://github.com/bulkan/shortcuts-for-trello) Chrome extension. Be sure to have a look at it and show them some love!

## Installation

Currently, you can only install this as an [unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked). Eventually, I'll publish this through the Chrome store. Well, maybe.

[chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).
