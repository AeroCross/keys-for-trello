# Keys for Trello

A Chrome extension that supercharges Trello with loads of keyboard shortcuts.

Based on the fantastic work of Bulkan Evcimen's [Shortcuts for Trello](https://github.com/bulkan/shortcuts-for-trello). Be sure to show them some love!

## Installation

Currently, you can only install this as an [unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked). Eventually, I'll publish this through the Chrome store.

### How to use

Configure shortcuts from the `Keyboard Shortcuts` menu accessible via the link at the bottom of
[chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).

- Open the Checklists dialog
- Open the Move Card dialog
